        The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.
        <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set,
             page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
    
             Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.

        Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

        The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in 
            some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
        
        As a "pure" container, the <div> element does not inherently represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily styled
        using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.
        
        In summary, can works as a container of its children
